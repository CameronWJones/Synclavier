2. "Technical Documentation" content is primarily for software and documentation developers.
3. "User Docomentation" content is intended for users creating audio with the system.
4. The "Development" subfolders contain hi-res scans and working OCR files.
5. The "Public" subfolders contains lo-res OCR pdf files suitable for distribution.
6. Hi-res scans are recommended at 300 dpi gray scale.
7. Public distributions are recommended at 144 dpi with searchable OCR content.
8. Back and front covers are not recommended in the document files. If you wish to scan in a front or back cover please make a separate full-color JPEG file that can be admired or printed if desired.
9. OCR for the first few releases was performed by Adobe Acrobat Pro X.
10. Blank pages should be inserted as needed to get the reader page numbers to match the document page numbers to the extent possible.
11. Ongoing projects could be done to convert the OCR scans to fully editable text files.
