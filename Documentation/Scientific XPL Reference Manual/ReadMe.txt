1. Hardcopy manual was scanned in at 300 dpi to 'Hi Res Scans'.
2. Adobe Acrobat X Pro was used to create searchable OCR versions in 'Hi Res OCR'.
3. Adobe Acrobat X Pro was used to create optimized OCR versions in 'Lo Res OCR'.
4. The Lo Res OCR files were combined to create the searchable 'Scientific XPL Reference Manual OCR Lo-Res.pdf'.
5. I started converting the manual to text-only. I have done 30 pages into 'Scientific XPL 001-030.pages'.
6. It's tedious; all the text needs checking and formatting. Some else can resume this task.
